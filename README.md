## i, I'm Troy!
- I was originally a CS undergraduate with an interest for research and impacting the lives of others that found my way to Ph.D. candidacy at Florida State University. Throughout my experience in the doctoral program, I realized my true passion lay in software engineering. I chose to change my path and I'm currently finishing my Master's degree at Georgia Tech to continue pursuing my rediscovered drive for software engineering and machine learning.
